# Wind energy taxonomy of topics

Controlled vocabularies such as taxonomies allow an accurate and controlled approach in describing datasets. One of such controlled vocabulary is Wind Energy Taxonomy of Topics. This taxonomy is the result of EERA JP WIND IRPWind Open Data initiative that took place in 2017 in which wind energy experts generated the first version of the taxonomy as an input for defining and structuring [wind energy metadata](https://zenodo.org/record/4013191). 

The report of this work is available at Zenodo: https://www.zenodo.org/record/1199489#.XSD6haeQ3RY 

In 2018, the taxonomy of topics was improved during the internal project of DTU Wind Energy titled 'FAIR Digitalization':

In 2020, the definition of taxonomy terms were added and the taxonomy was turn into FAIR and machine-actionable form, served to humans and machines using DTU Wind Energy OntoStack: http://data.windenergy.dtu.dk/ontologies/view/

Currently, the taxonomy is implemented in [DTU Data](https://data.dtu.dk/DTU_Wind_Energy), ShareWind and in [CEDAR](cedar.metadatacenter.org/) through integration with [OntoPortal](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/WETAXTOPICS/).
